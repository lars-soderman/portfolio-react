        <p id="w-node-5dc347d76953-d317cf04" class="project-text normal">We gathered loads of insights and data through user behavior observations, interviews and studying reports on childrens development, and digital and media consumption and behaviour. We had a look at several other apps and services, from the perspective of trying to understand just how this group is used to interacting with apps and services that are specifically targeted to kids. We were trying to understand what &quot;job&quot; the users needed help with, not just study the UI of competing audiobook services. We mapped out interesting and important motivating factors for the user group that we saw in the data. After boiling it all down, we formulated four different hypotheses. Each hypothesis based in an insight, and suggesting a specific action. <br></p>
        <p id="w-node-72030c699cf7-d317cf04" class="project-text comment">Our goal in research was to figure out what the <i>quarter inch hole</i> was, instead of focusing on the <i>quarter inch drill</i>, if you are familiar with <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/what-customers-want-from-your-products">that saying</a> :)<br></p>

          <p class="project-text hypotes-1">Hypothesis #1:<br></p>
          <p class="project-text hypotes-2">Confirmation and awards<br></p>
          <p class="project-text hypotes-3">Insight: Being awarded with external stimuli is an important motivator in terms of kids´ experiences. For example, many children can be motivated to do their math homework because they hope to have a little gold star pasted in their book. This kind of encouragement is central to the world of gaming, which is in its turn seems to be very present in the everyday life of many in this age group.<br><br>Action: Give the user different kinds of confirmation based on their audiobook consumption. For example based on how much time the user has spent listening, whether the user has listened to all the parts in a series, how the user has listened to different genres, whether the user has shifted between listening (audiobook) and reading (e-book), etc. The award itself can be in the shape of a medal, a badge, an achievement or a new ”level”.<br></p>

          <p class="project-text hypotes-2">Personalization<br></p>
          <p class="project-text hypotes-3">Insight: Users in general tend to have a stronger connection with a service where they have participated in creating a piece of the experience. We see this in many popular games aimed at this age group, how choosing, building and styling the avatar is a big part of the gaming experience. But also that there is an expectation that any digital experience is going to personalized in a broader sense, that there is some kind of intelligence on the other side that knows what the user wants.<br><br>Action: Give users the possibility to choose and build their own avatar and to customize its color scheme, its clothing, its hairdo etc. The user&#x27;s age affects the style of the avatar. Find relevant ways to implement the avatar in the navigation experience in order to further emphasize its importance. At the first login, the user will get to choose a number of areas of interest, which will help BookBeat give relevant advice to the user. <br></p>

          <p class="project-text hypotes-2">Sharing<br></p>
          <p class="project-text hypotes-3">Insight: For children 9-12, group affiliation and social interactions are important. They are used to and appreciate being able to share their digital experience with their friends.<br><br>Action: Give users the ability to share their experience from within the app, perhaps in an interesting, fun and unexpected way - via text message or social networks. We also give them the possibility of writing book reviews, and commenting on other users reviews.<br></p>

          <p class="project-text hypotes-1">Hypothesis 4:<br></p>
          <p class="project-text hypotes-2">Scrolling<br></p>
          <p class="project-text hypotes-3">Insight: our user testings have shown that the age group have an interesting scrolling behavior - very active and fast, up-down-up-down. Elements of horisontal scrolling within a vertically scrolling page is easily missed and has to be learned. From our obervations, it seems to be more natural for kids in this age group to only scroll in one direction. <br><br>Action: We adjust the experience to respond to this behavior, by increasing the vertical depth and reducing the horisontal depth. We increase the size and clarity of the book titles and covers, to make them more easily perceived in this navigation tempo.<br></p>

We recognized that the kids profiles navigation and user experience needed to be further differentiated from &quot;grown-ups BookBeat&quot;. Enter: BookBeat Kids - our proposal for a framework that would contain a sort of a kids mode with its own UI, but still within the same Bookbeat app. We set out to create a new onboarding flow incorporating our thoughts on how a new user could make and modify their avatar, choose their areas of interest, and also to show how the avatar could be present in the navigation.<br></p><img src="images/Skärmavbild-2020-01-08-kl.-22.44-1.png" srcset="images/Skärmavbild-2020-01-08-kl.-22.44-1-p-500.png 500w, images/Skärmavbild-2020-01-08-kl.-22.44-1-p-800.png 800w, images/Skärmavbild-2020-01-08-kl.-22.44-1-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Skärmavbild-2020-01-08-kl.-22.44-1.png 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" id="w-node-d474a351f765-d317cf04" alt="" class="project-image big">
        <p id="w-node-753d518db865-d317cf04" class="project-text normal">Based in our findings we decided the brand persona for Bookbeat Kids needed to be fun, calm, independent and emotional. A moodboard (↑) for the graphics was created. A clear and strong color palette to contrast between container and content, and to be easily identified in the high paced navigation - but at the same time with a sense of softness and calm in order to work in the most common listening situation according to our survey - at bedtime. The solution was to look towards Bauhaus, but with slightly more pastel colors. <br></p>
